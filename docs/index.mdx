# Shaket Protocol

**Shaket** is an **open protocol for multi-agent negotiation and auction** built on the [Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol](https://a2a-protocol.org).

Enable autonomous agents to negotiate deals and run competitive auctions with structured coordination, state management, and A2A-based communication. Shaket fills a critical gap by enabling AI agents representing different parties with conflicting interests to transact. Shaket handles the protocol layer - you bring your agent's intelligence.
