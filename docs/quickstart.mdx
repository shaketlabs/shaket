## Run Your First Reverse Auction

Run a reverse auction where 5 sellers compete to offer the best price:

```bash
python examples/powerbank_reverse_auction.py
```

### What happens:
- Buyer initiates a 3-round auction for a power bank
- 5 sellers with different strategies (aggressive, conservative, balanced, last-minute) submit offers
- Each round, sellers see market feedback (min/max/avg prices) and adjust their bids
- Winner is determined by the lowest final price

### Expected Output:
```
🔄 Round 1/3
   💚 Seller_E  [aggressive  ] $ 85.00 (initial)
   💚 Seller_A  [aggressive  ] $ 95.00 (initial)
   ...

🔄 Round 2/3
   💚 Seller_E  [aggressive  ] $ 85.00 → $ 81.08 (-$3.92)
   ...

🎯 BEST OFFER: $76.44 from Seller_E
```

## Run LLM-Powered Negotiation

Run an intelligent negotiation using LLMs:

```bash
python examples/powerbank_negotiation_llm.py
```

### What happens:
- Buyer and seller agents use LLMs (via LiteLLM) to make decisions
- Agents analyze market conditions, opponent offers, and negotiate intelligently
- Multi-round back-and-forth until agreement or max rounds reached
